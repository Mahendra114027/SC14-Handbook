#History of Free Software Movement Karnataka (FSMK)

A few activists from Bangalore decided to build the free software movement in Karnataka on the lines of a mass movement rather then the anarchist approach that existed in the global free software movement. These activists started working with pre-existing groups such as FSUG-Bangalore and FSF-India since the end of 2005 and were part of organising several activities and programs such as the GPLv3 conference in 2006, protests and programs related to patents in software, forming GLUGs in local engineering colleges, community computing centres, national conventions among others.

With the pro-mass-movement activists intensifying activities across the state of Karnataka, there was a disagreement among certain members in the pre-existing community on the use of the mass movement approach
and this disagreement intensified over the period of several years. With no other option to solve the dilemma in organisational approach the activists decided to start another organisation. Finally, on 7th April 2009 FSMK was announced to the world via an announcement to various mailing lists. and its objectives and organisational approach were clearly specified.

With similar organisations coming up in other states of the country,
there was a need to have a coordinating body at the national level.
The first option was to get FSF-India to lead this movement at the
national level. However, Richard Stallman intervened and stated that
FSF-India was not intended to have a democratic organisational
structure to lead a democratic peoples' movement and hence advised on
starting alternate bodies to do the needful. The formation of FSMI was
announced in the valedictory function of the National Free Software
Conference - 2010 held in Bangalore during 20â€“21 March 2010.

###[Archive] Original email that was circulated to announce the formation of FSMK

We, the Free Software Movement Team having been consistently working
to build the Free Software Movement in Karnataka, have decided to
consolidate our efforts by forming an organisation. Our work has been
built on the work of the pioneers of Free Software in the country.

After much deliberation, we have decided to name our organisation the
'Free Software Movement - Karnataka' to symbolise the all inclusiveness
of the Movement. What differentiates us from other groups, organisations
or networks is our approach to building the Movement. Our scientific
understanding is that only a 'mass movement' in the FOSS domain can
bring about the various changes that we envision. To build such a mass
movement, a democratic, transparent, representative and dynamic
organisation is essential.

We understand that to address the various challenges before the
Free Software Movement it is essential to have broad based coordination
among the various entities operating in the FOSS domain, in conformance
with our principles. It should be noted that we are not affiliated to FSF-I
or any other entity, at present. We represent the Free Software Movement.
Prof Eben Moglen and RMS have been our inspiration.

The Convener is Senthil S.(9900262828) <senthilsos@yahoo.com> and
Jt. Convener is Vikram Vincent (9448810822) <vincentvikram@gmail.com>

This core team is supported by a group of academicians, people from the
industry and students from around Karnataka.

####What is a mass movement?

Mass movement : is a word with comes from geology. It is the
geomorphic process by which soil, regolith, and rock move down slope
under the force of gravity.

Mass movement can be over varying timescales from seconds to years.

Mass movement may occur at a very slow rate, particularly in areas that
are very dry or those areas that receive sufficient rainfall such that
vegetation has stabilised the surface.

It may also occur at very high speed, such as in rock slides or landslides.

We aim to be a MASS MOVEMENT in FREE SOFTWARE

We would like to be a group of hacktivists - who can be catalysts in reaching
the idea of free software to a large number of people - including the
people who don't have hardware - by giving them free hardware to start with.

Whether the mass movement in free software in India is going to be
rapid or slow - is going to depend on You Waking up to the philosophy
of free software.
