# **Exercises**


----------
 1. Take the w3schools quiz [here][1].
 2. If you score above 17, go on to Exercise 3. Otherwise, revisit your basics and do Exercise 1 again.
 3. We will be adding jQuery effects to the Sunday School project, made during the exercise of the HTML track. You need your index.html page, style.css and script.js.
    * Add a div below the site header saying "Free as in Freedom." which should disappear. (Hint: [fadeOut][2]) 
    * Add a button having an id __btn1__ saying __Subscribe me!__ beside your header in your .html file. In your .js file add a jQuery function such that once the mouse enters the button, it highlights and when you leave the button, it fades out. (Hint: [mouseenter][3]) _Note: Change your opacity of the button to 0.5 in your .css file._
    * Using HTML, put a small picture of yours on the index.html and a button below it saying __Click Me!__. Write a jQuery function such that once you click the button, your picture fades out slowly. (Hint: [button.click][4]) 
    * Use your imagination and add some more jQuery effects.
 5. Take the jQuery drill [here][5]. Try to finish any 20.
 6. Take the complete codecademy course [here][6].

And you're done!
